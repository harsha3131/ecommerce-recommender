# E-commerce Product Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive product recommendation system for an e-commerce platform. The system utilizes multiple recommendation techniques including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid approach, and an advanced multi-modal deep learning model to provide highly personalized product recommendations to users based on their purchase and browsing history.

## Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends products based on the purchase behavior of similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends products based on the attributes of the products the user has previously interacted with.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for more robust recommendations.
- **Multi-Modal Deep Learning**: Leverages product images, text descriptions, and user-item interactions using a sophisticated neural network architecture.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A web application built with Flask for easy interaction and visualization of recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For backend logic and data processing.
- **PyTorch**: For building and training the multi-modal neural network model.
- **Flask**: Web framework for creating the web application.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Sentence Transformers**: For natural language processing of product descriptions.
- **PyTorch Geometric**: For graph-based neural network components.
- **ResNet50**: For image feature extraction.
- **HTML/CSS**: For frontend design.

## System Architecture
The recommendation system consists of four main components:

1.  **Collaborative Filtering Module**: Analyzes user purchase patterns to find similar users and recommend products they've purchased.

2.  **Content-Based Filtering Module**: Analyzes product attributes (especially categories) and user browsing history to recommend similar products.

3.  **Hybrid Recommendation Module**: Combines results from both collaborative and content-based approaches, with fallback to popular products when necessary.

4.  **Multi-Modal Deep Learning Model**: A sophisticated neural network that processes:
    -   User embeddings
    -   Product embeddings
    -   Image features (using ResNet50 with fashion-specific optimizations)
    -   Text features (using Sentence Transformers)
    -   Graph-based relationships (using Graph Convolutional Networks)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Flask
- Pandas
- Sentence Transformers
- PyTorch Geometric
- Torchvision
- PIL

### Installation
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd er
    ```

3.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Dataset Setup
1.  Download the DeepFashion dataset from [official website](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html)

2.  Create a `datasets` directory in the project root:
    ```bash
    mkdir datasets
    ```

3.  Extract the downloaded dataset into the `datasets` directory. The directory structure should look like:
    ```
    datasets/
      â”œâ”€â”€ shape_ann/
      â”œâ”€â”€ test_images/
      â””â”€â”€ train_images/
    ```

4.  Place the following data files in the project root:
    -   users_expanded.csv
    -   products_expanded.csv
    -   product_images_expanded.csv
    -   purchases_expanded.csv
    -   browsing_history_expanded.csv

**Note**: The dataset files are not included in the repository due to their large size. Please download them separately.

## Running The Application
1.  Start the Flask server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2.  Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

## Data Files
1.  `users_expanded.csv`: Contains user information.
2.  `products_expanded.csv`: Contains product details such as name, category, description, price, and rating.
3.  `product_images_expanded.csv`: Contains mappings between products and their image files.
4.  `purchases_expanded.csv`: Contains user purchase history.
5.  `browsing_history_expanded.csv`: Contains user browsing history.

## Dataset
The system uses fashion product images from the DeepFashion dataset, which includes various clothing items with multiple view angles (front, side, back, full). The multi-modal model is specifically optimized for fashion recommendations with view-aware processing.

## Usage
1.  Enter a user ID and select a recommendation method (collaborative, content-based, hybrid, or multi-modal).
2.  Click on "Get Recommendations" to view the recommended products.
3.  The system will display both products the user has interacted with and new recommendations.

## Multi-Modal Model Details
The multi-modal model (`MultiModalModel` class) integrates multiple data sources:

-   **Collaborative Filtering Component**: User and product embeddings.
-   **Image Processing Component**: Fashion-optimized ResNet50 with view-type awareness (front, side, back, full views).
-   **Text Processing Component**: Sentence transformer to encode product descriptions.
-   **Graph Component**: Graph convolutional network for modeling product relationships.
-   **Fusion Layer**: Combines all modalities for final recommendation scores.

## Future Enhancements

-   **More Data**: Plans to expand the dataset to enhance the model's recommendation capabilities.
    
-   **Clean UI**: Improving the user interface (UI) to enhance user experience and engagement.

-   **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a way for users to provide feedback on the recommendations, which can help refine the system.

-   **Explainability**: Work on explaining the reasoning behind recommendations, which can enhance user trust and satisfaction.

-   **Model Optimization**: Fine-tune the multi-modal model for better performance and faster inference.

-   **Additional Modalities**: Incorporate more data sources such as user demographics and seasonal trends.
